# DRM Solutions for Spotify Playback in Electron

## Problem

Spotify's Web Playback SDK requires **Widevine DRM** (Digital Rights Management) to play encrypted music content. Standard Electron builds don't include Widevine due to licensing restrictions, which causes the EME error: "No supported keysystem was found."

## Current Status

✅ **DRM Detection**: The app now detects when Widevine is unavailable and shows a helpful warning modal.
✅ **User Guidance**: Users are presented with clear options when DRM is not supported.
✅ **Graceful Degradation**: The app continues to work for browsing playlists, just without playback.

## Available Solutions

### 1. **Use Web Browser (Recommended)**
- **How**: Click "Open in Browser" in the DRM warning modal
- **Why**: Chrome, Firefox, and Safari include Widevine DRM by default
- **Pros**: Full functionality, no setup required
- **Cons**: Loses frameless window design

### 2. **Widevine-Enabled Electron Build**
- **How**: Use pre-compiled Electron with Widevine or build with Widevine CDM
- **Options**:
  - `electron-builder` with Widevine configuration
  - Custom Electron build with Widevine CDM
  - Use Electron alternatives like `electron-forge` with Widevine
- **Pros**: Keeps desktop app experience
- **Cons**: Complex setup, licensing considerations

### 3. **Alternative Frameworks**
- **Tauri**: Rust-based alternative using system webview (may have DRM)
- **Neutralino**: Lightweight alternative using system browser engine
- **CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework)**: Custom application with Widevine support

### 4. **Spotify Preview Mode**
- **How**: Use Spotify's 30-second preview URLs instead of full playback
- **Implementation**: Modify track playback to use `preview_url` from Spotify API
- **Pros**: No DRM required, works in any environment
- **Cons**: Only 30-second previews, limited functionality

## Technical Implementation Details

### Current DRM Detection
```typescript
// Checks for Widevine availability
const drmSupported = await navigator.requestMediaKeySystemAccess('com.widevine.alpha', config);
```

### Electron Configuration Attempts Made
- ✅ Added `plugins: true` and `experimentalFeatures: true`
- ✅ Added permission handlers for `protectedMediaIdentifier`
- ✅ Disabled `webSecurity` for OAuth compatibility
- ❌ Widevine CDM still not available (requires special Electron build)

## Recommendations

### For Development/Testing
1. Use the web browser version for full functionality
2. Keep the Electron version for UI/UX development and non-playback features

### For Production
1. **Hybrid Approach**: Electron app that opens browser for playback when needed
2. **Preview Mode**: Implement 30-second previews for a desktop-native experience
3. **Custom Build**: Investigate Widevine-enabled Electron builds for full functionality

## Future Considerations

- **Licensing**: Widevine requires Google licensing for distribution
- **Maintenance**: Custom Electron builds require ongoing maintenance
- **User Experience**: Consider what features are most important vs implementation complexity

The current implementation provides the best user experience by detecting the limitation and offering clear alternatives.
