## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Spotify Premium account
- Access to Spotify Developer Dashboard

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:rmpacheco/vorbis-player.git
   cd vorbis-player
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up Spotify App**
   - Create a new app at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Choose "Web Playback SDK" for planned API usage
   - Add redirect URI: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/spotify/callback`
   - **Important**: Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for Spotify OAuth compatibility
   - Copy your Client ID

3. **Configure environment**

   ```bash
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your Spotify Client ID
   ```

   Required in `.env.local`:

   ```
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id_here"
   VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/spotify/callback"
   ```

4. **Prepare your Spotify account**
   - Ensure you have a Spotify Premium subscription
   - Create playlists with your favorite music and/or like songs to build your Liked Songs collection
   - The app will access your playlists and liked songs to display tracks

5. **Set up the proxy server (for YouTube video discovery)**

   ```bash
   npm run proxy:install
   ```

6. **Start the app**

   For development with full video functionality:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all  # Starts both proxy server and dev server
   ```

   Or start components separately:
   ```bash
   npm run proxy:start  # Start proxy server (in separate terminal)
   npm run dev          # Start development server (in another terminal)
   ```

7. **First run**
   - Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000>
   - Click "Connect Spotify" to authenticate
   - Choose from your playlists or select "Liked Songs" for shuffled playback
   - Music starts automatically with accompanying videos
   - Use the queue icon to browse your playlist
   - Access settings via the gear icon for video management
   - Hover over any video to retry with alternative content if needed

## Deployment

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist/` folder contains static files that can be deployed to any web hosting service (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

### Proxy Server Deployment

For full video functionality in production, the proxy server must also be deployed:

1. **Deploy the proxy server** to a Node.js hosting service (Railway, Render, Heroku, etc.)
2. **Update the YouTube search service** to use your production proxy URL
3. **Configure CORS** in the proxy server for your production domain

**Important**: 
- Update the Spotify redirect URI in your app settings to match your production domain
- The proxy server is required for YouTube video discovery due to CORS restrictions
- Without the proxy server, the app will function but videos won't load automatically

## Troubleshooting

### "No tracks found"

- Ensure you have a Spotify Premium subscription
- Create playlists with music or like some songs in Spotify to build your Liked Songs collection
- Check that your Spotify account has music accessible
- Verify your Spotify app has the correct scopes and permissions

### Video Issues

- **"Video unavailable"**: Hover over the video and click "üîÑ Try Another" to find alternative content
- **No videos loading**: The app automatically searches for alternatives; this is normal behavior
- **Persistent video failures**: The system learns and avoids problematic videos automatically

### Authentication Issues

- Double-check your Client ID in `.env.local`
- Ensure redirect URI matches exactly in both `.env.local` and Spotify app settings
- Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for Spotify OAuth compatibility
- Try clearing browser storage and re-authenticating

### Proxy Server Issues

- **Check proxy server status**: Run `npm run proxy:test` to verify it's running
- **Proxy server not starting**: Ensure Node.js is installed and run `npm run proxy:install`
- **Videos not loading**: Verify proxy server is running on port 3001
- **Development setup**: Use `npm run dev:all` to start both proxy and client together

### Performance Issues

- Clear localStorage to reset video blacklist: `localStorage.clear()` in browser console
- Refresh the page if videos stop loading consistently
- The app is optimized for continuous playback; occasional video misses are expected
- If proxy server becomes unresponsive, restart it with `npm run proxy:start`
