## Critical Implementation Details

### Liked Songs System (New Feature)

- **Playlist Selection**: 'liked-songs' special playlist ID for Liked Songs
- **Automatic Shuffle**: Liked Songs are automatically shuffled using `shuffleArray()` helper function
- **API Integration**: New Spotify API functions for liked songs management:

### Auto-Play System

- **Initial Auto-Play**: First song automatically starts when tracks are loaded
- **Auto-Advance**: Detects song end via Spotify player state (within 1s of completion) and advances to next track
- **Infinite Loop**: Returns to first track after last song for continuous playback
- **State Management**: Uses `isInitialLoad` flag and proper useEffect dependency ordering to prevent initialization errors

### Visual Effects Settings System

- **Global Persistence**: Visual effects settings stored in localStorage as 'vorbis-player-album-filters'
- **Real-time Application**: Filter changes applied immediately to album artwork with smooth transitions
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Visual effects preferences survive browser restarts and page refreshes
- **Dynamic Theming**: UI elements adapt to filter changes and extracted colors
- **Performance Optimization**: Hardware-accelerated CSS filters with efficient update cycles

### Performance Optimizations

- **Color Extraction Caching**: LRU cache in `colorExtractor.ts` with 100 item limit for 50-60% faster transitions
- **Component Memoization**: React.memo applied to heavy components like AlbumArt and VisualEffectsMenu
- **Lazy Loading**: VisualEffectsMenu and other heavy components loaded on-demand
- **Resource Hints**: DNS prefetch and preconnect for Spotify API and image CDNs
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and tree-shaking for reduced bundle size

### Volume Modal System

- **Responsive Interface**: Modal with different controls based on device type
- **Desktop Experience**: Full volume slider (0-100%) with real-time visual feedback
- **Mobile Experience**: Volume adjustment buttons (+10/-10) with current level display

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Liked Songs Not Loading

- **Root Cause**: Missing user-library-read scope or no liked songs in account
- **Solution**: Verify Spotify app scopes and ensure user has liked songs
- **Location**: Check `spotify.ts` getLikedSongs() function

### Album Art Filters Not Working

- **Root Cause**: Missing `albumFilters` prop in AlbumArt component
- **Solution**: Always pass `albumFilters={albumFilters}` to AlbumArt component
- **Location**: AudioPlayer.tsx line ~704

### Performance Issues

- **Color Extraction**: Ensure colorExtractor.ts cache is properly implemented
- **Component Re-renders**: Verify React.memo is applied to heavy components
- **Bundle Size**: Check that lazy loading is properly configured

### Type Inconsistencies

- **Filter Types**: Ensure filter interfaces match between components
- **Invert Property**: AlbumArtFilters expects boolean, VisualEffectsMenu uses number
- **Solution**: Standardize on single type across all filter components

### Development Workflow

- **Single server**: Use `npm run dev` for development
- **Visual effects testing**: Test all filter combinations for performance
- **Component hierarchy**: AudioPlayer â†’ AlbumArt â†’ AlbumArtFilters for filter application
- **Performance monitoring**: Use React DevTools Profiler for performance analysis
