- **Health Check**: `npm run proxy:test` verifies proxy server is running
- **Production**: Proxy server must be deployed alongside the client application

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Liked Songs Not Loading

- **Root Cause**: Missing user-library-read scope or no liked songs in account
- **Solution**: Verify Spotify app scopes and ensure user has liked songs
- **Location**: Check `spotify.ts` getLikedSongs() function

### Album Art Filters Not Working

- **Root Cause**: Missing `albumFilters` prop in AlbumArt component
- **Solution**: Always pass `albumFilters={albumFilters}` to AlbumArt component
- **Location**: AudioPlayer.tsx line ~704

### Performance Issues

- **Color Extraction**: Ensure colorExtractor.ts cache is properly implemented
- **Component Re-renders**: Verify React.memo is applied to heavy components
- **Bundle Size**: Check that lazy loading is properly configured

### Type Inconsistencies

- **Filter Types**: Ensure filter interfaces match between components
- **Invert Property**: AlbumArtFilters expects boolean, VisualEffectsMenu uses number
- **Solution**: Standardize on single type across all filter components

### Development Workflow

- **Always run both servers**: Use `npm run dev:all` for full functionality
- **Test proxy health**: Run `npm run proxy:test` if videos not loading
- **Component hierarchy**: AudioPlayer â†’ AlbumArt â†’ AlbumArtFilters for filter application
- **Performance monitoring**: Use React DevTools Profiler for performance analysis
