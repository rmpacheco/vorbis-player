# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is **Vorbis Player** - a React-based audio-visual player that combines Spotify music streaming with intelligent YouTube video discovery. The app streams music from a user's Spotify account and automatically finds relevant YouTube videos for each track, creating a unified music-video experience with advanced content filtering and persistent learning capabilities.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
tsc -b && vite build

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Proxy server commands (for YouTube search bypass)
npm run proxy:install    # Install proxy server dependencies
npm run proxy:start      # Start proxy server
npm run proxy:test       # Test proxy server health
npm run dev:all          # Start both proxy and dev server
npm run start:all        # Start both proxy and preview server
```

## Architecture

### Core Components Flow

1. **App.tsx** - Handles Spotify OAuth authentication flow and renders the main AudioPlayerComponent
2. **AudioPlayerComponent** - Main orchestrator that manages audio playback, track selection, and coordinates between playlist and video display. Includes integrated VideoPlayer within a unified card interface
3. **VideoPlayer** - Handles YouTube video discovery, embedding, and retry logic with persistent blacklist system
4. **Playlist** - Collapsible drawer interface showing track listing with current track highlighting

### Key State Management

- `currentTrackIndex`: Tracks which song is currently selected/playing
- `showPlaylist`: Controls visibility of the sliding playlist drawer
- `isInitialLoad`: Prevents auto-play from triggering multiple times
- `globalVideoBlacklist`: Persistent Set of failed video IDs stored in localStorage
- Track selection sync: When users click playlist items vs. use audio player next/prev buttons
- Auto-play progression: Seamless advancement between tracks with end-of-song detection

### Authentication & Data Flow

- **Spotify Integration**: Uses PKCE OAuth flow for secure authentication with required scopes
- **Music Streaming**: Streams from user's Spotify playlists using Web Playback SDK (Premium required)
- **Video Discovery**: Intelligent YouTube search via proxy server to bypass CORS restrictions
- **Content Filtering**: Advanced filtering removes ads, promotional content, and low-quality videos
- **Persistent Learning**: Failed video IDs are stored in localStorage and excluded from future searches

### Video Discovery Architecture

- **YouTube Search Service**: Web scraping approach via local proxy server with rate limiting and caching
- **Video Search Orchestrator**: Coordinates search, filtering, and quality scoring with fallback strategies
- **Content Filter Service**: Filters ads, promotional content, low-quality videos with channel quality assessment
- **Video Quality Service**: Assesses video resolution and quality metrics
- **Blacklist System**: Global persistent blacklist prevents retry loops for non-embeddable videos
- **Retry Mechanism**: Hover overlay allows manual retry with alternative video discovery

## Environment Configuration

Required environment variables in `.env.local`:

```
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id"
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/spotify/callback"
```

Optional (for backward compatibility):

```
VITE_DROPBOX_APP_KEY="your_dropbox_app_key"
VITE_DROPBOX_REDIRECT_URI="http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/dropbox/callback"
```

## Critical Implementation Details

### Auto-Play System

- **Initial Auto-Play**: First song automatically starts when tracks are loaded
- **Auto-Advance**: Detects song end via Spotify player state (within 1s of completion) and advances to next track
- **Infinite Loop**: Returns to first track after last song for continuous playback
- **State Management**: Uses `isInitialLoad` flag and proper useEffect dependency ordering to prevent initialization errors

### Video Blacklist System

- **Global Persistence**: `globalVideoBlacklist` Set stored in localStorage as 'vorbis-player-video-blacklist'
- **Automatic Exclusion**: All video searches exclude blacklisted IDs to prevent retry loops
- **Manual Blacklisting**: Retry button adds current video to blacklist before searching alternatives
- **Cross-Session Memory**: Blacklist survives browser restarts and page refreshes
- **Cache Integration**: Works with video search orchestrator's `findAlternativeVideos` method

### Playlist Drawer System

- **Sliding Interface**: Fixed-position drawer slides from right with smooth animations
- **Responsive Design**: 400px width on desktop, full-width on mobile
- **Overlay Backdrop**: Click-to-close overlay with blur effects
- **Auto-Close**: Drawer closes automatically when user selects a track
- **Space Optimization**: Maximizes video viewing area while keeping playlist accessible

### YouTube Integration Challenges

- **CORS Bypass**: Uses local proxy server for YouTube search to avoid browser restrictions
- **Embedding Detection**: Client-side detection of YouTube embedding restrictions is limited by CORS
- **Retry Strategy**: Manual retry system with hover overlay when videos fail to embed
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented in YouTube search service with exponential backoff

### Spotify Integration

- **Web Playback SDK**: High-quality music streaming with full playback controls
- **Player State Monitoring**: Real-time state changes for auto-advance and track synchronization
- **Premium Requirement**: Playback functionality requires Spotify Premium subscription
- **Token Management**: Automatic token refresh for long-term authentication sessions
- **Authentication Flow**: Handles callback at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/spotify/callback`

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: styled-components with custom theme system and some Tailwind CSS
- **Audio**: Spotify Web Playback SDK
- **Video**: YouTube iframe embedding with intelligent discovery via proxy server
- **Authentication**: Spotify Web API with PKCE OAuth
- **Content Intelligence**: Advanced filtering and quality assessment algorithms
- **Storage**: localStorage for persistent blacklist and user preferences
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styled-components
- **State Management**: React hooks with localStorage persistence
- **Build Tool**: Vite with HMR and concurrent proxy server support

## Service Layer Architecture

### YouTube Services
- **youtubeSearch.ts**: Core YouTube search with web scraping via proxy, caching, and rate limiting
- **videoSearchOrchestrator.ts**: High-level coordination of video discovery with quality scoring and fallback strategies
- **contentFilter.ts**: Filters out ads, promotional content, and low-quality videos with channel assessment
- **videoQuality.ts**: Assesses video resolution and quality metrics
- **youtube.ts**: Basic YouTube utilities for video ID extraction and embed URL creation

### Spotify Services
- **spotify.ts**: Spotify Web API integration for playlists and authentication
- **spotifyPlayer.ts**: Spotify Web Playback SDK wrapper with state management

### Support Services
- **adminService.ts**: Admin panel functionality (legacy from previous version)
- **dropbox.ts**: Dropbox integration (legacy, kept for backward compatibility)

## Proxy Server Integration

The application includes a Node.js proxy server in `proxy-server/` directory to bypass CORS restrictions for YouTube search:

- **Purpose**: Enables client-side YouTube video discovery without API keys
- **Development**: Use `npm run dev:all` to start both proxy and client simultaneously
- **Health Check**: `npm run proxy:test` verifies proxy server is running
- **Production**: Proxy server must be deployed alongside the client application
