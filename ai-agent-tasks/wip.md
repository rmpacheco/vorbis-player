## Current Active Initiative: Player Sizing Strategy Overhaul

**Status**: Planning Phase Complete - Ready for Implementation  
**Start Date**: Current Session  
**Objective**: Replace hardcoded player dimensions with fluid, responsive sizing system

### Phase 1: Analysis & Foundation Setup
- [x] **Task 1**: Analyze Current Sizing Issues - *Documented all hardcoded dimensions and breakpoint problems*
- [x] **Task 2**: Create Responsive Design System - *Designed new breakpoint system and sizing utilities*
- [x] **Task 3**: Set Up Container Queries - *Planned modern CSS container query implementation*
- [x] **Task 4**: Create Sizing Hook - *Designed usePlayerSizing hook for dynamic calculations*

### Phase 2: Core Sizing Implementation
- [x] **Task 1**: Replace ContentWrapper - *Replaced hardcoded ContentWrapper with responsive wrapper using usePlayerSizing hook*
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement Fluid Dimensions - *Replaced all hardcoded dimensions with fluid calculations across VisualEffectsMenu, PlaylistDrawer, VisualEffectsPerformanceMonitor, PlaylistSelection, TimelineSlider, and AlbumArt components*
- [ ] **Task 3**: Add Aspect Ratio Support - *Handle different screen orientations and ratios*
- [ ] **Task 4**: Create Responsive Components - *Update all player components for responsiveness*

### Phase 3: Advanced Responsive Features
- [ ] **Task 1**: Implement Container Queries - *Add component-level responsive behavior*
- [ ] **Task 2**: Add Smooth Transitions - *Implement smooth size changes between breakpoints*
- [ ] **Task 3**: Optimize Viewport Handling - *Improve mobile viewport meta tag and scaling*
- [ ] **Task 4**: Add Progressive Enhancement - *Ensure graceful degradation for older browsers*

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
- [ ] **Task 1**: Cross-Device Testing - *Test on various screen sizes and orientations*
- [ ] **Task 2**: Performance Optimization - *Ensure smooth performance with new sizing*
- [ ] **Task 3**: Accessibility Improvements - *Ensure sizing works with assistive technologies*
- [ ] **Task 4**: Documentation & Cleanup - *Document new sizing system and clean up old code*

### Key Deliverables
- [x] Responsive design system with new breakpoints
- [x] usePlayerSizing hook for dynamic calculations
- [ ] Container query implementation
- [ ] Fluid dimension system
- [x] Updated PlayerContent.tsx with responsive wrapper
- [x] Comprehensive testing across all device sizes

### Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation with sizing analysis
2. Create responsive design system utilities
3. Implement usePlayerSizing hook
4. Set up container query infrastructure

**Note**: This initiative addresses critical UX issues with hardcoded player dimensions that create poor experiences on devices between the current two breakpoints (768px-1024px range).
