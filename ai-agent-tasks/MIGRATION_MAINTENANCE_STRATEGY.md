# Migration and Maintenance Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive strategy for migrating from a dual-mode Vorbis Player to separate web and desktop applications, along with long-term maintenance approaches. The strategy addresses technical migration, user experience continuity, data preservation, and ongoing maintenance responsibilities.

---

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Pre-Migration Preparation

#### 1.1 Data Backup and Export Strategy
**Timeline**: Week -2 to Week -1 (before extraction begins)

**User Data Inventory**:
- Local music library database (SQLite)
- User preferences and settings
- Custom playlists and favorites
- Play history and statistics
- Visual effects configurations
- Window layouts and UI preferences

**Backup Implementation**:
```typescript
// Backup service for user data preservation
interface UserDataBackup {
  version: string;
  timestamp: string;
  database: {
    tracks: Track[];
    playlists: Playlist[];
    settings: UserSettings;
    statistics: PlaybackStatistics;
  };
  preferences: {
    ui: UIPreferences;
    audio: AudioSettings;
    library: LibrarySettings;
  };
}
```

**Backup Process**:
1. **Automatic Backup**: Before any update that affects data structure
2. **Manual Backup**: User-initiated export functionality
3. **Cloud Backup**: Optional encrypted cloud storage
4. **Format**: JSON with schema versioning for forward compatibility

#### 1.2 User Communication Strategy
**Timeline**: 4 weeks before migration

**Communication Channels**:
- In-app notifications with migration timeline
- Email notifications to registered users
- Website banner with detailed information
- Social media announcements
- GitHub repository updates

**Key Messages**:
- Benefits of the separation (performance, features, maintenance)
- Timeline and what to expect
- Data safety and migration guarantees
- New features coming to each version
- Support resources and contact information

**Communication Template**:
```

### 2. Technical Migration Process

#### 2.1 Codebase Separation Timeline
**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Create vorbis-desktop repository
- Set up build and CI/CD pipeline
- Extract core desktop functionality
- Establish shared component libraries

**Phase 2: Feature Migration (Weeks 2-3)**
- Migrate local music services
- Extract and optimize desktop components
- Remove web-specific dependencies
- Implement desktop-specific enhancements

**Phase 3: Data Migration (Week 4)**
- Implement automatic data migration
- Create migration validation tools
- Test with various library sizes
- Implement rollback mechanisms

**Phase 4: Testing (Weeks 5-6)**
- Comprehensive testing across platforms
- Performance regression testing
- User acceptance testing
- Migration scenario testing

**Phase 5: Release (Week 7)**
- Production release preparation
- Staged rollout to users
- Monitor migration success
- Provide user support

#### 2.2 Data Migration Implementation

**Migration Service Architecture**:
```typescript
interface MigrationService {
  // Detect current installation and data
  detectCurrentInstallation(): InstallationInfo;
  
  // Backup current data
  createBackup(): Promise<BackupResult>;
  
  // Migrate data to new format
  migrateData(backup: UserDataBackup): Promise<MigrationResult>;
  
  // Validate migration success
  validateMigration(): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  
  // Rollback if needed
  rollbackMigration(): Promise<RollbackResult>;
}
```

**Migration Steps**:
1. **Detection**: Identify existing Vorbis Player installation
2. **Backup**: Create comprehensive backup of all user data
3. **Schema Migration**: Update database schema to new version
4. **Data Transfer**: Migrate tracks, playlists, and settings
5. **Validation**: Verify data integrity and completeness
6. **Cleanup**: Remove old data after successful migration

**Migration Validation**:
- Track count verification
- Playlist integrity checks
- Settings preservation validation
- Performance benchmark comparison
- User preference migration verification

#### 2.3 Rollback Strategy

**Rollback Triggers**:
- Migration failure or data corruption
- Critical bugs in new version
- User dissatisfaction or issues
- Performance regression beyond acceptable limits

**Rollback Implementation**:
```typescript
interface RollbackService {
  // Check if rollback is possible
  canRollback(): boolean;
  
  // Execute rollback to previous version
  executeRollback(): Promise<RollbackResult>;
  
  // Restore user data from backup
  restoreUserData(backup: UserDataBackup): Promise<RestoreResult>;
  
  // Validate rollback success
  validateRollback(): Promise<ValidationResult>;
}
```

**Rollback Process**:
1. **Stop Current Version**: Gracefully shut down new application
2. **Restore Previous Version**: Reinstall previous version if needed
3. **Restore Data**: Restore user data from backup
4. **Validate Restoration**: Ensure all data is accessible
5. **User Notification**: Inform user of rollback and next steps

### 3. User Experience Migration

#### 3.1 Onboarding for Existing Users

**First Launch Experience**:
1. **Welcome Screen**: Explain the changes and improvements
2. **Data Migration Status**: Show migration progress and results
3. **Feature Tour**: Highlight new desktop-specific features
4. **Settings Review**: Allow users to review and adjust settings
5. **Library Verification**: Let users verify their music library

**Migration UI Components**:
```typescript
// Migration progress component
const MigrationProgress = () => {
  return (
    <MigrationContainer>
      <ProgressBar value={migrationProgress} />
      <StatusMessage>
        Migrating your music library... {currentStep}
      </StatusMessage>
      <Details>
        {migratedTracks} of {totalTracks} tracks migrated
      </Details>
    </MigrationContainer>
  );
};
```
