# Task 1: Analyze Current Sizing Issues

## Objective
Document all hardcoded dimensions, breakpoints, and sizing-related code in the current player implementation to understand the full scope of changes needed.

## Current State Analysis

### Hardcoded Dimensions Found
- **PlayerContent.tsx**: `1024px × 1186px` (default) and `768px × 922px` (max-height: 1024px)
- **VisualEffectsMenu.tsx**: `400px` width
- **PlaylistDrawer.tsx**: `400px` width  
- **VisualEffectsPerformanceMonitor.tsx**: `300px-400px` width range

### Breakpoint Issues
- Single breakpoint: `@media (max-height: ${theme.breakpoints.lg})` (1024px)
- No consideration for width-based breakpoints
- No mobile-specific sizing
- No tablet optimization

### Layout Problems
- Fixed positioning causing overflow issues
- No aspect ratio considerations
- Poor mobile experience
- Gaps between breakpoint sizes

## Tasks

### 1.1 Document All Sizing Code
- [ ] Scan all components for hardcoded dimensions
- [ ] Document current breakpoint usage
- [ ] Identify responsive design patterns (or lack thereof)
- [ ] Note any viewport meta tag issues

### 1.2 Analyze Device Coverage Gaps
- [ ] Test current player on various screen sizes
- [ ] Document where sizing breaks down
- [ ] Identify optimal breakpoints for different device types
- [ ] Note aspect ratio issues

### 1.3 Create Sizing Audit Report
- [ ] List all hardcoded dimensions with file locations
- [ ] Document current breakpoint logic
- [ ] Identify components that need responsive updates
- [ ] Note performance implications of current approach

## Deliverables
- Complete audit of current sizing implementation
- List of all components requiring updates
- Device coverage analysis report
- Recommendations for new breakpoint system

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All hardcoded dimensions documented
- [ ] Current breakpoint logic fully understood
- [ ] Device coverage gaps identified
- [ ] Clear understanding of scope of changes needed
