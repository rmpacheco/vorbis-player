 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <LocalLibraryDrawer
 *   isOpen={showLibrary}
 *   onClose={() => setShowLibrary(false)}
 *   onTrackSelect={handleTrackSelect}
 *   currentTrackId={currentTrack?.id}
 *   accentColor={accentColor}
 * />
 * ```
 * 
 * @props {boolean} isOpen - Controls drawer visibility
 * @props {() => void} onClose - Callback when drawer should close
 * @props {(track: LocalTrack) => void} onTrackSelect - Track selection handler
 * @props {string} currentTrackId - Currently playing track ID for highlighting
 * @props {string} accentColor - Theme accent color for visual consistency
 * 
 * @state
 * - stats: Library statistics loaded from database

### Example Implementation
```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Unified Player Service
 * 
 * Central orchestration service that manages playback across multiple sources
 * (Spotify and local music). Provides a unified interface for player controls,
 * state management, and event handling regardless of the music source.
 * 
 * @architecture
 * This service acts as the central coordinator between:
 * - Spotify Web Playback SDK (spotifyPlayer)
 * - Local audio engine (localAudioPlayer)
 * - Database services (enhancedLocalLibraryDatabaseIPC)
 * - UI components (AudioPlayer, SpotifyPlayerControls)
 * 
 * @responsibilities
 * - Unified state management for all playback sources
 * - Event routing and normalization between different audio engines
 * - Queue management and track progression
 * - Volume control and audio settings
 * - Error handling and recovery
 * 
 * @events
 * - playbackStarted: Fired when any track starts playing
 * - playbackPaused: Fired when playback is paused
 * - trackEnded: Fired when a track finishes (triggers auto-advance)
 * - volumeChanged: Fired when volume is adjusted
 * - error: Fired when playback errors occur
 * 
 * @usage
 * ```typescript
 * const player = new UnifiedPlayerService();
 * player.on('playbackStarted', ({ track, source }) => {
 *   console.log(`Playing ${track.name} from ${source}`);
 * });
 * await player.play(track);
 * ```
 * 
 * @dependencies
 * - localAudioPlayer: Local file playback engine
 * - spotifyPlayer: Spotify Web Playback SDK wrapper
 * - enhancedLocalLibraryDatabaseIPC: Database operations
 * 
 * @author Vorbis Player Team
 * @version 2.0.0
 */
```

## 4. Type Definitions Documentation

### Problem
Type definitions lack explanations of their purpose and relationships.

### Solution
Add detailed JSDoc comments for all interface definitions, explaining type relationships and usage examples.

### Example Implementation
```typescript
/**
 * Enhanced Track interface supporting both Spotify and local music sources
 * 
 * This interface extends the base SpotifyTrack with additional properties
 * needed for local music playback. It serves as the unified data structure
 * for all tracks regardless of their source.
 * 
 * @interface EnhancedTrack
 * @extends SpotifyTrack
 * 
 * @property {'spotify' | 'local'} source - Music source identifier
 * @property {string} [filePath] - Local file path (local tracks only)
 * @property {string} [format] - Audio format (local tracks only)
 * @property {number} [bitrate] - Audio bitrate in kbps (local tracks only)
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const spotifyTrack: EnhancedTrack = {
 *   id: 'spotify:track:123',
 *   name: 'Song Title',
 *   source: 'spotify',
 *   // ... other SpotifyTrack properties
 * };
 * 
 * const localTrack: EnhancedTrack = {
 *   id: 'local_abc123',
 *   name: 'Local Song',
 *   source: 'local',
 *   filePath: '/path/to/song.mp3',
 *   format: 'mp3',
 *   bitrate: 320
 * };
 * ```

// Before:
const formatTotalDuration = (ms: number): string => {
  const hours = Math.floor(ms / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  const minutes = Math.floor((ms % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  
  if (hours > 0) {
    return `${hours}h ${minutes}m`;
  }
  return `${minutes}m`;
};

// After:
/**
 * Formats total duration in milliseconds to human-readable format
 * 
 * Converts milliseconds to hours and minutes display format.
 * Shows hours only when duration exceeds 1 hour for cleaner display.
 * 
 * @param ms - Duration in milliseconds
 * @returns Formatted duration string (e.g., "2h 30m" or "45m")
 * 
 * @example
 * formatTotalDuration(9000000) // "2h 30m"
 * formatTotalDuration(2700000) // "45m"
 */
const formatTotalDuration = (ms: number): string => {
  const hours = Math.floor(ms / (1000 * 60 * 60));
  const minutes = Math.floor((ms % (1000 * 60 * 60)) / (1000 * 60));
  
  if (hours > 0) {
    return `${hours}h ${minutes}m`;
  }
  return `${minutes}m`;
};
```
