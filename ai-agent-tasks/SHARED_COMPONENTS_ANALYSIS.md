## Conclusion

The shared component analysis reveals significant opportunities for code reuse and consistency improvements. By extracting shared components into dedicated libraries, both the web and desktop versions will benefit from:

- **Reduced Maintenance**: Single source of truth for common functionality
- **Improved Consistency**: Unified design and behavior patterns
- **Better Testing**: Focused testing for shared components
- **Faster Development**: Reusable components speed up feature development

The recommended approach of gradual extraction with comprehensive testing will minimize risk while maximizing the benefits of shared code. The investment in shared libraries will pay dividends in long-term maintainability and development velocity.
